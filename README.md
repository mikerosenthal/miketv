This program requires a raspberry pi.
it plays videos using the omxplayer video player that is the only one that reliably works on that platform. 
for any given folder it will treat each subfolder as a "tv channel" by choosing a random video file and starting it at a random start time. as you flip through the channels using page up / page down (currently pretty custom/hard-coded to work with my wireless usb remote/mini-keyboard it simulates television by skipping ahead the appropriate amount of time when you circle back to the other channels. 

it is some cludgy ugly shit right now, hacked together by someone who doesnt know how to code by trial and error and googling. feel free to change anything/everything to make it better!
